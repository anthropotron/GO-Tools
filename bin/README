Check that these settings are correct for your site. (Hint: They
probably won't be.)

use lib 

Include the path to the lib directory of this distribution.

$goDir

This should contain the path to directory containing gene_association
and gene_ontology files.

$goParseDir

To speed things up, the tools can read Storable objects which contain
the pre-parsed association files for the different aspects. These
files are generated by the "update" script. These are not required for
general use, and the tools will revert to the non-parsed files if the
parsed ones are not found.

$confFile (GOTermFinder only)

The path to the default GO::View configuration file.

$binDir and $libDir (GOTermFinder only)

These are passed to the GO::View module to locate the graphviz
binaries and shared libraries. GO::View simply adds these to the PATH
and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so if they are in standard locations you may not
need to worry about them. The can also be overridden by command line
options.

$map2slimPath (GOTermMapper only)

The path to the map2slim script.
